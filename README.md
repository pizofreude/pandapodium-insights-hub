```

**Brief Explanation:**

*   **Data Sources:** Product catalog data is scraped from [PandaPodium.cc](https://pandapodium.cc/). Sales transactions, customer data, and web clickstream data are synthetically generated or adapted from public e-commerce datasets. Public real-time streams (e.g., Wikimedia EventStreams, GTFS-Realtime) are used for the streaming component.
*   **Ingestion:** Batch data is loaded using `dlt` and Python scripts orchestrated by Airflow. Streaming data is ingested via Kafka/MSK and processed by PyFlink.
*   **Storage:** Raw and processed data resides in Amazon S3, forming the data lake. PostgreSQL is used for development warehousing to minimize cloud costs.
*   **Processing & Transformation:** PySpark handles large-scale batch transformations. `dbt` is used for SQL-based data modeling and transformation within the data warehouse (Athena for prod, Postgres for dev). AWS Glue Data Catalog provides schema for Athena.
*   **Orchestration:** Apache Airflow manages and schedules batch data pipelines.
*   **Infrastructure:** All AWS infrastructure is provisioned and managed using Terraform. Docker is used for containerizing applications/services where appropriate.
*   **Visualization:** Metabase is used for development dashboards, while Tableau Public is used for production-ready, shareable visualizations.

## Data Sources

_(Still in data exploration and highly likely additional/removal of data sources will happen.)_

1.  **Product Catalog (Scraped):**
    *   Source: [PandaPodium.cc](https://pandapodium.cc/) (publicly available product information)
    *   Fields: Product Name, Prices, Brand, Image URLs, Descriptions, Specifications, Categories, Stock Status, etc.
    *   Method: Web scraping (ensure ethical considerations and respect for `robots.txt` if applicable for a real-world scenario).
2.  **Sales Transactions (Synthetic/Public):**
    *   Source: Adapted from public e-commerce datasets (e.g., Kaggle datasets) and enhanced with synthetic data generation (Faker).
    *   Fields: Transaction ID, Customer ID, Product ID (linked to scraped catalog), Quantity, Price, Timestamp, Region.
3.  **Customer Data (Synthetic/Public):**
    *   Source: Adapted from public e-commerce datasets and enhanced with synthetic data generation (Faker).
    *   Fields: Customer ID, Name, Region, Signup Date, Age (simulated).
4.  **Web Clickstream Data (Synthetic):**
    *   Source: Generated synthetically using Python (Faker, random) to simulate user interactions.
    *   Fields: Session ID, User ID, Timestamp, Event Type (page_view, product_view, add_to_cart), Product ID (linked to scraped catalog).
    *   *This data is primarily intended for the streaming pipeline.*
5.  **Public Real-Time Streams (for Streaming Component):**
    *   Source: Examples include Wikimedia EventStreams (recent changes) or GTFS-Realtime feeds from public transit agencies.
    *   Purpose: To demonstrate real-time data ingestion and processing capabilities.

    pip install -r requirements.txt # Create a requirements.txt for Python dependencies
    ```

3.  **Configure AWS Credentials:**
    Ensure your AWS CLI is configured with the necessary permissions. Terraform will use these credentials.
    ```bash
    aws configure
    ```

4.  **Deploy Infrastructure with Terraform:**
    *   Navigate to the appropriate environment directory (e.g., `terraform/dev/`).
    *   Initialize Terraform:
        ```bash
        terraform init
        ```
    *   (Optional) Plan the deployment:
        ```bash
        terraform plan
        ```
    *   Apply the configuration:
        ```bash
        terraform apply
        ```
    *   *Note: You might need to manually create an S3 bucket for Terraform remote state backend before running `terraform init` if you configure it that way.*

5.  **Set up `dbt` Project:**
    *   Navigate to the `dbt/` directory.
    *   Configure your `profiles.yml` (typically located in `~/.dbt/profiles.yml`) with connection details for your dev (Postgres) and prod (Athena) environments.
    *   Install dbt dependencies:
        ```bash
        dbt deps
        ```

6.  **Run Data Generation/Scraping Scripts:**
    *   Execute scripts in the `scripts/` directory to populate initial data (e.g., scrape product catalog, generate synthetic sales data).
    *   *(Provide specific commands here)* [TO-DO]

7.  **Start Local Services (Docker Compose):**
    If using Docker for Airflow, Redpanda, Postgres (dev), Metabase:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d # From the directory containing your docker-compose.yml
    ```

8.  **Configure Airflow Connections:**
    Once Airflow is running, configure connections to AWS, Spark, etc., through the Airflow UI.
